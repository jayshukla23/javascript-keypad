************

The keypad takes in input from the mouse and the keyboard as well. 

You can use the number keys, or the numpad for the same. 

Press the same key multiple times to switch the character associated with that key.

Press (or click on) 0 (zero) twice to put a space.
Use the Backspace key to delete the last character entered.
